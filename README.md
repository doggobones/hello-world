## A bit about me
Yo whats up guys. I'm bonehead and today I'm spending some time trying to learn github and starting my path to excellence. 
I went down a youtube rabbithole yesterday and realized that i'm not at all as smart as I've thought I was my whole life. 
I am really glad that I came to this realization because I've been frustrated with how *slowly* I feel like I progress in roles at various companies and with different skills, and it's good to finally understand
that things should not happen instantaneously. There is work to be done, it **takes time**, and there **is no** shortcut to success.

## My goals
I'm not entirely sure what my long-term goals are. I jump through a lot of tutorials and try to find things that seem interesting to me. Yesterday it was cybersecurity, today it's python and ML. I think the real magic
will come once I stick with anything long enough to build something cool.

### Python
I haven't done any real coding (i only get to use ladder logic at work) since college so my main focuses right now are the following:
-Refresher on syntax
-establishing a regular daily practice
-deciding on a project to work at that will help me learn

### ML
I have only a vague understanding of what machine learning is. I took 1 graduate course on computer vision that was sick but there were undergrads in the course that made it look easy lol. Anyways goals:
-Youtube Rabbit Hole
-Lex fridman lectures (my guy)
-Understanding capabilities of scope
-Can I make something solo that does something neat? *if so flex*

## Closing Remarks
Alright that's it for now. Going to try to remember to come back and update this throughout my journey, maybe use it like a diary or a manly online journal. Too much lives in my brain maybe dumping it out once in a while will be helpful.
If anyone reads this and has anything helpful to toss my way it'd be appreciated. Or if not just sit back and wait for more updates you might get some chuckles out of 'ole bonehead.

# Looks like i jumped the gun
had to circle back, following the tut and i edited the read-me before making a new branch. making some changes to test branching and merging.
